# Database-Design-Project
An academic project that involved the design and development of a database with tables normalized and complex SQL queries written to extract insightful information from the data.
Built and organized a unique way of letting the owners select breeding partner for pets just like the way people use it on Tinder and a match between them would result in the further mating process.
